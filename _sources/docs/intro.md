# Welcome

The goal of this tutorial is to give you a first impression of some important tools and concepts in Python when doing data science or statistics projects. 

A typical project looks something like this {cite:p}`Wickham2016`: 

```{image} ../_static/img/data-science.png
:alt: datascience
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:width: 600px
:align: center
```

Surrounding all these steps is programming and the usage of different tools like Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebooks, Anaconda and GitHub. Youâ€™ll use these tools in almost every data science project and this book will give you a short introduction into the most important basics.
